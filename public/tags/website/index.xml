      <description>Building this site My site before this was built by hand to learn HTML and CSS. I was excited to have something of my own online but it quickly became neglected because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an easy way to add new posts. I would have to login to my server and manually add what I wanted by writing a new page in HTML.
I had learned what Hugo was a while ago while trying to find an easier way to make a good looking site that was easy to manage.</description>
