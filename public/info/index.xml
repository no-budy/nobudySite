      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been editing for 6+ years. I&amp;rsquo;ve used most popular editing software from Blender and Premiere Pro to my personal favorite Davinci Resolve. I focus on consistancy and fast turn around times while matching the style needed for the intended audience. Below I have linked some videos that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. If you have anymore questions or would like an editor, email me at nobudy@nobudy.xyz
