      <description>Melee in 2023 I&amp;rsquo;d known melee existed as a competitive game for years but until slippi there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a way for people to play casually. There had been netplay attempts with melee before but waiting around in lobbys or dolphin&amp;rsquo;s community servers wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great experience.
I play fox Sometime last month I started playing online while I couldn&amp;rsquo;t play desktop competitive games. I was playing a lot of lichess and offline gamecube games.</description>

      <title>Starting With Hugo</title>

      <description>Building this site My site before this was built by hand to learn HTML and CSS. I was excited to have something of my own online but it quickly became neglected because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an easy way to add new posts. I would have to login to my server and manually add what I wanted by writing a new page in HTML.
I had learned what Hugo was a while ago while trying to find an easier way to make a good looking site that was easy to manage.</description>
