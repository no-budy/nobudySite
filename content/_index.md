# What is this place?
---
This is my personal site where I'd like to start posting about things that I'm doing in and outside of school.
Right now I'm a student at OSU studying CS and Engineering and Working as a Video editor part-time.

## Video editing
---
I edit video part time while I'm in school. If you have any video editing needs personal, business, Youtube or otherwise; I'm your guy. Check out the [video editing](https://nobudy.xyz/videoediting/videoediting/) page! 


## Computer Science
---
I'm also a student currently at THE Ohio State University, studying computer science. If you are here looking to hire I'll link my digital resume [here](). I don't keep one with my name and personal info online so if you have any questions or would like a pdf copy, email me at nobudy@nobudy.xyz
